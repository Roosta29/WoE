                <h2>Publishers</h2>
                <p>
                    Game publishers create and distribute video games. Their main revenue sources are game sales and the
                    sale of
                    downloadable in-game content (DLC). Publishers range from large, publicly traded companies that
                    develop
                    a variety of
                    games in different genres (EA, Activision-Blizzard) to privately held companies that create one or
                    two
                    key titles (Riot
                    Games, Valve). Because publishers create and own game intellectual property, all other stakeholders
                    are
                    reliant on
                    publisher approval (either directly or otherwise) to host competitions, broadcast streams, and even
                    play. This is in
                    contrast to traditional sports, where the NBA and NFL do not own the rights to the sports of
                    basketball
                    and football,
                    respectively, but only those rights to their professional leagues. Through this all encompassing IP
                    ownership,
                    publishers control a significant portion of the power & money within the esports ecosystem. <br><br>

                    Until relatively recently, esports were viewed simply as a marketing tool for these companies;
                    creating
                    and enabling
                    competitive scenes around a game drives spending on the game itself and on DLC within the game.
                    However,
                    as the modern
                    era of esports dawns, publishers are increasingly embracing the full revenue potential associated
                    with
                    esports as a
                    standalone product. Both Riot Games and Activision-Blizzard are in the process of launching
                    franchised
                    leagues that are
                    poised to capitalize on increased fees for media rights, sponsorships, and more. <br><br>

                    Publishers have taken different approaches as to how involved they are with their games’ esports
                    activities. Riot, for
                    example, operates both their North American and European leagues (LCS) soup to nuts, while Valve is
                    focused on its core
                    mission as a game publisher and embraces a laissez-faire approach, opting to stay relatively hands
                    off —
                    other than
                    selecting tournament organizers — for its Counter-Strike and Dota 2 Majors. This is why the
                    infographic
                    makes the
                    crucial distinction between publisher-run and third party operated competitions.

                <h2>Teams</h2>
                <p>
                    Esports teams are organizations which typically oversee multiple esports rosters/players under one
                    unified brand.
                    Imagine, for example, if the Dallas Cowboys competed in football, basketball, soccer, tennis, and
                    rugby
                    and also had
                    content deals with retired sports stars– that’s the current state of most successful professional
                    esports teams. The
                    household esports team names include, among others, Cloud9, Fnatic, Team Liquid, and Team SoloMid
                    (TSM)
                    – these teams
                    have accrued large fan followings and are able to impact all other stakeholders in the ecosystem,
                    primarily through
                    deciding which games their organization will compete in. This is one of the biggest differences
                    between
                    esports and
                    traditional sports: an esports team can leverage its brand in a wide array of different esports, as
                    opposed to being
                    exclusively tied to a single game or league. <br><br>

                    Big teams attract big players and big fan bases. This has historically given larger teams more
                    leverage
                    — and in turn
                    sponsorship dollars — with brands, platforms, tournament organizers, and publishers. <br><br>

                    While teams have traditionally made the majority of their money through sponsorships, the maturation
                    of
                    the industry is
                    also diversifying their revenue streams – revenue sharing of media rights, gate and concession sales
                    (in
                    a regionalized
                    model such as OWL), and exclusive content distribution fees from platforms such as Twitch and
                    Facebook
                    are becoming the
                    new norm.

            <div class="text-area">
                <h2>Players</h2>
                <p>
                    Professional esports athletes. Big names include TSM Bjergsen, C9 Sneaky, and Team Liquid’s JDM.
                    Professional players
                    maintain training schedules akin to professional athletes – their average practice time is more than
                    ten
                    hours per day
                    and includes scrimmages, physical and mental training, and film study. Some players also stream in
                    their
                    free time. <br><br>

                    Though their primary source of income is salaries from their teams, Players have a variety of income
                    sources, including
                    streaming ad/subscription revenues, prize money, individual sponsorships, fan donations, and
                    merchandise
                    sales.

            <div class="text-area">
                <h2>Competitions</h2>
                <p>
                    Tournaments and leagues created and hosted by event organizers. Competitions are run either directly
                    by
                    game publishers,
                    such as Riot’s ‘League of Legends Championship Series’ (LCS) and Activision-Blizzard’s ‘Overwatch
                    League’ (OWL), or by
                    third parties, such as Turner’s ‘ELEAGUE’, and Electronic Sports League’s (ESL) ‘ESL One’. Third
                    party
                    tournament
                    organizers (TO’s) are reliant on publisher permissions as TO’s must obtain a license to broadcast a
                    competition
                    featuring a publisher’s game. <br><br>

                    Competitions make their income primarily through media rights fees, sponsorships, concessions, and
                    ticket sales.

            <div class="text-area">
                <h2>Platforms</h2>
                <p>
                    Streaming networks and social media platforms. Twitch has dominated this marketplace since it was
                    founded, but for the
                    first time in more than five years it is facing meaningful competition from the likes of YouTube
                    Gaming,
                    Facebook, and
                    Mixer. <br><br>

                    Platforms distribute both live and video on-demand (VOD) content. They often sponsor teams, players,
                    and
                    competitions
                    (both publisher and third party run) in order to obtain exclusive broadcast rights to content.
                    Through
                    team
                    sponsorships, platforms also have access to the streams of professional players – imagine Facebook
                    live-streaming Lebron
                    James while he lifts, shoots free throws, and plays pickup. <br><br>

                    Platforms sell ads, custom content integrations, and premium subscription services. For example,
                    Twitch
                    and YouTube
                    Gaming allow viewers to subscribe to individual channels for $5/month, revenues from which which are
                    shared between
                    Twitch and the streamer. The viewer receives an ad-free experience (on the subscribed channel only)
                    and
                    oftentimes,
                    additional benefits courtesy of the streamer such as private chat access, special emotes to use on
                    the
                    channel’s chat,
                    and even subscriber games where the streamer plays live with their fans.

            <div class="text-area">
                <h2>Brands & Advertisers</h2>
                <p>
                    Companies that sponsor within the esports ecosystem. These include Coca Cola, Razer, Intel, and
                    T-Mobile. Brand
                    activations vary dramatically – team sponsorships, platform ad runs, individual player partnerships,
                    league/competition
                    sponsorships, and others have all been utilized to reach the often difficult to find millennial male
                    demographic. <br><br>

                    Brands within the ecosystem are often separated into two categories: endemic & non-endemic. Endemic
                    brands create
                    products that gamers use in their competitive gaming endeavors: mice, keyboards, monitors, PC’s,
                    headsets and others.
                    Non-endemic brands produce products ancillary to esports and are using esports stakeholders to reach
                    a
                    target audience. <br><br>

                    Brand investment in esports has significantly increased over the past few years. The esports market
                    is
                    young (55% of
                    fans are between 21-35), valuable (average household income of $76,000), and experiencing explosive
                    growth throughout
                    the west (76% growth in the number of US esports fans from 2015 to 2016), so it’s not hard to see
                    why
                    more and more
                    blue-chip brands are targeting the space. As the esports ecosystem continues to grow and viewership
                    increases, brands
                    will have more opportunities and vehicles through which they can invest.

            </div>
            <div class="text-area">
                <h2>Fans</h2>
                <p>
                    People who watch esports – both live and online. The esports audience skews male, educated, and
                    affluent. Fans typically
                    play games, support teams (often multiple teams), consume ads on streaming platforms for both their
                    favorite streamers
                    and competitions, purchase merchandise and are exposed to sponsor’s products through brand’s
                    marketing
                    efforts. <br><br>

                    Each game has its own unique community ecosystem with individual dynamics. The League of Legends
                    community, for example,
                    is known for its high expectations from Riot Games and competitive passion, often leading to toxic
                    exchanges on Reddit
                    and Twitter. <br><br>

                    Fan communities can influence publisher, team, player and brand actions within the esports space.
                    Unlike
                    in traditional
                    sports where fans are typically not engaged in regular, direct dialogue with team executives and
                    league
                    officials,
                    esports’ culture of open access and dialogue has developed a multi-way conversation between game
                    communities and the
                    stakeholders within them. <br><br>

                    The esports ecosystem in 2017 is excitingly intricate and ever-changing: we expect many of the
                    dynamics
                    to change with
                    the professionalization and franchising of esports over the next few years.
