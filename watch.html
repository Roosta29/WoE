                <p>When most people think about live esports streaming, they think of Twitch. Twitch has the most
                    concurrent
                    streamers and tournaments by far and offers the most variation of gaming titles to watch. It’s
                    common
                    for esports titles like League of Legends, Fortnite and CS:GO to have the top viewing spots, with
                    over
                    100,000 concurrent fans watching and cheering along at any one time.
                    <br><br>
                    Twitch is the top streaming platform in eSports, per eCharts, for a reason. It really
                    started as the foundation for live
                    streaming tournaments and games, which is a big reason for its popularity today. Whether you want to
                    watch someone play
                    Madden, 2K, Call of Duty, LoL or another game, Twitch offers it. It’s the perfect place to get
                    started whenever you have
                    free time.</p>

                <p>YouTube Gaming, Google’s rival platform to Twitch, followed on from Twitch’s success by allowing for
                    gamers to live stream their gameplay directly to the YouTube platform and keep a catalogue of their
                    past
                    streams for their fans to enjoy instantly. With YouTube already having a massive audience that were
                    searching for gaming videos, with Minecraft tutorials and Call of Duty montages being some of the
                    most
                    popular videos, it was a logical step to expand into live streaming.
                    <br><br>
                    Even when there aren’t live matches going on, YouTube archives offer plenty of replays for
                    people to familiarize
                    themselves with eSports. Of course, one of the most entertaining eSports is Rocket League, which is
                    a must-watch for
                    sports fans looking for that perfect combination of racing games and soccer. Whatever type of
                    eSports you desire,
                    YouTube offers it.
