                    Discord is a free app that allows you to communicate with others via voice, video, and text. Discord
                    is
                    a messaging service that is intended for gamers. It has many features, including a game mode for if
                    you’re
                    livestreaming so you don’t show private information, voice chat, emotes (if that’s your thing), and
                    a
                    lot of other
                    features useful for gamers. It can be used as a regular messaging service as well though, even if
                    you’re
                    not a gamer. It
                    is also very easy to set up your own server, and you can download the app or use it through your web
                    browser.
