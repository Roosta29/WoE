                <h2>The First of Many</h2>
                <img src="img/space-invade.png" class="right">
                <p>
                    Competitive gaming has existed almost as long as video games themselves. Even the earliest arcade
                    games
                    inspired some
                    fierce competition. Early on, a lot of that competition took the form of friends challenging each
                    other to
                    best their
                    high scores, but it didn’t take long for organized tournaments to begin popping up.<br><br>

                    Atari held the first video game competition, the Space Invaders Tournament, in 1980. It attracted
                    more than
                    ten thousand
                    participants. This tournament, and others like it in following years, sowed the seeds of what would
                    eventually become
                    eSports. <br><br>

                    By the time the 1990s came around, tournaments for arcade and console games had become increasingly
                    common,
                    with
                    companies like Nintendo and Blockbuster sponsoring world championships. Competitive gaming was at
                    this point
                    so new that
                    some tournaments offered brackets for children and teenagers to compete in, a concession no longer
                    necessary
                    today.

                <h2>PC's Success</h2>
                <img src="img/quake.jpg" class="left">
                <p>
                    The 1990s saw the rise of PC gaming, and along with this came the first true eSports
                    competitions.<br><br>

                    1997’s Red Annihilation tournament for the first person shooter (FPS) “Quake” is widely considered
                    to have
                    been thefirst real instance of eSports, drawing over 2,000 participants. The winner received Ferrari
                    previously owned by John Carmack, lead developer for “Quake.”<br><br>

                    Just a few weeks after Red Annihilation, the Cyberathlete Professional League, one of the first
                    major gaming
                    leagues was founded. Later that year, the CPL held its first tournament. By the next year, it was
                    already
                    offering $15,000 in prizemoney. The CPL was just one of the more prominent of many new tournaments
                    and
                    leagues founded during this period.<br><br>

                    At this time, most eSports focused on first person shooters, sports games, and arcade-style games,
                    but the
                    late 90s also
                    saw the release of the breakout real-time strategy (RTS) hit “StarCraft: Brood War.”<br><br>

                    While shooters focus on twitch skills and fast reflexes, RTS games also require careful thought and
                    long-term planning
                    and have been compared to a modern version of chess. With its asymmetrically balanced races, each
                    with their
                    own unique
                    troops and abilities, “StarCraft” offered nearly limitless strategic potential and became one of the
                    driving
                    forces of
                    the eSports world, though it would not reach the height of its popularity until after the year 2000.

                <h2>Esports' Rise</h2>
                <img src="img/starcraft.jpg" class="right">
                <p>
                    Esports truly started to come into its own after the turn of the millennium, with the rise of both
                    popular
                    tournaments
                    and the games that now make up the backbone of the eSports world.<br><br>

                    The year 2000 saw the launch of the World Cyber Games and the Electronic Sports World Cup, both
                    major
                    international
                    tournaments that continue to be held every year. These helped set the tone for the kind of big name
                    tournaments that
                    have come to define the eSports world.<br><br>

                    Major League Gaming (MLG) launched in 2002 and is now the largest and most successful of the eSports
                    leagues, featuring
                    numerous games in a variety of genres – from shooters to RTS games – and offering lavish prize
                    pools. How
                    lavish? The
                    2013 Winter Championships awarded gamers with over a hundred and seventy thousand dollars in
                    prizes.<br><br>

                    MLG was also the first tournament to be televised in North America, with a 2006 “Halo 2” series
                    being shown
                    on the USA
                    Network, though it did not succeed in establishing a major television presence over the long
                    haul.<br><br>

                    These days MLG, like most eSports tournaments, is primarily viewed online, though it draws huge
                    numbers. The
                    2012 spring
                    championship brought in over four million viewers, even beating “real” sporting events, like the
                    2012 NBA
                    All-Star Game,
                    in certain key demographics.<br><br>

                    Other major tournaments to arise in recent years include an eSports tournament at Dreamhack – a
                    massive
                    Swedish computer
                    festival drawing attendees from all over the world – and the Global StarCraft II League (GSL), a
                    South
                    Korean league
                    widely considered to be the most prestigious “StarCraft II” competition and thus arguably the
                    pinnacle of
                    the RTS gaming
                    world. The GSL has been doubling its viewers every year since its launch in 2010 and currently
                    boasts more
                    than fifty
                    million viewers around the world. If this trend continues, it will crack one hundred million by the
                    end of
                    the year.<br><br>

                    eSports tournaments would be nothing without exciting, spectator-friendly games for competitors to
                    play. The
                    last decade
                    has seen the release of most of these games.
                    eSports Starcraft 2.<br><br>

                    Sci-fi FPS franchise “Halo” is a pillar of the FPS world, enticing players and spectators alike with
                    its
                    intense,
                    fast-paced gameplay. As previously mentioned, “StarCraft II” – launched in 2010 – sits atop the RTS
                    world,
                    having taken
                    everything that made the original “StarCraft” great and improved it with enhanced graphics and new
                    strategic
                    possibilities.<br><br>

                    A relative newcomer to the eSports world is the MOBA, or Multiplayer Online Battle Arena, genre.
                    Based on
                    the fan-made
                    “Defense of the Ancients” mod for “Warcraft III” – another game from Blizzard Entertainment,
                    developers of
                    the
                    “StarCraft” franchise – MOBAs are similar to RTS games but allow players to control only a single
                    hero on
                    the
                    battlefield. This forces them to rely on other players to defeat the enemy army.<br><br>

                    MOBAs have exploded in popularity and now dominate much of the eSports world. Most popular among
                    these is
                    “League of
                    Legends” or “LoL.” Released in 2009, some claim “LoL” to be the most played video game in the world,
                    with
                    over 30
                    million players and tournaments that attract thousands of viewers and offer millions in
                    prizes.<br><br>

                    The 2011 “LoL” tournament at Dreamhack is reported to have had over 1.6 million viewers worldwide.
                    The
                    following year,
                    2012’s “LoL” Season Two World Championship attracted eight thousand live viewers, 900,000 worldwide
                    viewers,
                    and a prize
                    pool of over five million dollars.

                <h2>What now?</h2>
                <img src="img/league.jpg" class="left">
                <p>
                    As video games become ever more popular, so too do eSports. The more people play games, the more
                    potential
                    fans of
                    eSports there are. And as games grow more advanced, they become more exciting for
                    spectators.<br><br>

                    eSports has yet to achieve popularity in mainstream culture, but the phenomenon is fast approaching
                    a
                    tipping point
                    where it will. eSports tournaments continue to grow in size and viewership, and each year brings
                    them closer
                    to the
                    level of popularity and acceptance enjoyed by physical sports. Take, for example, the activity known
                    as
                    BarCraft, where
                    “StarCraft II” fans gather in bars to watch pro matches over a cold beer and some snacks.<br><br>

                    Don’t be surprised if future MLG or GSL tournaments generate the same fevered excitement as the
                    World Series
                    of Poker.
